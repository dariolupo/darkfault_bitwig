# Darkfault for Bitwig
A dark theme for Bitwig Studio. 
This is my take of what would possibly be an official Dark mode in Bitwig. 

To be used with [Theme Editor by Berikai](https://github.com/Berikai/bitwig-theme-editor)

## What's included
- Main .json file to be installed with [Theme Editor](https://github.com/Berikai/bitwig-theme-editor)
- A couple optional color palettes that work nice with the theme

## Instructions
- Backup your files and folders!!!
- Install theme file using [Theme Editor](https://github.com/Berikai/bitwig-theme-editor)
- If you want to use the included custom icons, replace the original ones in the respective Bitwig app folders:
  - /Resources/icons/browser
  - /Resources/images/library
- For the palettes just follow official Bitwig instructions
